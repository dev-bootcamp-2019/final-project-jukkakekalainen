# final-project-jukkakekalainen

The final project for the Consensys Academy demonstrates fully working Dapp (a decentralized application),
build on Ethereum blockchain, with Solidity smart contracts. More on [design desicions](design_pattern_desicions.md) and [avoiding comman attacks](avoiding_common_attacks.md) on their own documents.  

### General use registration Dapp

 - Allows the organizer to create free or priced events with wanted maximum participation cap and expiry time.
 - The user uses web interface to register on events.
 - Ethereum address is the registration ID for the user.
 - When user register on priced event, the payment goes directly to the organizers Ethereum address.  
 - A small fee is taken from the organizer on event creation.

### Live on the Rinkeby Testnet 

[Rinkeby UI](http://bl.ocks.org/jukkakekalainen/raw/f9f2d1452a9eb179c57768804c7cd3a0/) Requires [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) browser extension.


### Installation on Ubuntu Linux environment

This project uses [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com), that includes Solidity compiler and [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) to simulate blockchain. 

```sh
$ npm install truffle -g
$ npm install -g ganache-cli
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-bootcamp-2019/final-project-jukkakekalainen.git
$ cd final-project-jukkakekalainen
$ ganache-cli
$ truffle migrate
```

### Testing while Ganache running on background 

```sh
$ truffle test
Using network 'development'.

  Contract: RegistrationSystem
    ✓ should create an free to participate event (133ms)
    ✓ should create an priced event (114ms)
    ✓ should allow registering (61ms)
    ✓ should revert due wrong amount (61ms)
    ✓ should fail due too many participants (285ms)

5 passing (701ms)
```

### Hosting user interface locally 

```sh
$ sudo npm install http-server -g
$ cd ui && http-server
  Starting up http-server, serving ./
  Available on:
    http://127.0.0.1:8080
    http://10.0.2.15:8080
  Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

* Edit line 432 on /ui/index.html "var contractInstance = myContract.at(""... to point to your contract address generated by Ganache on your personal blockhain.
